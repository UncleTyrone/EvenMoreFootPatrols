# **Even More Foot Patrols**
## A classic coming back for more! Now with dynamic spawn timing this mod adds more foot patrols and more police to your game! Comes pre-loaded with additional routes and is configurable through json file.

Based on the original [More Foot Patrols](https://www.nexusmods.com/schedule1/mods/404) mod.


If you want to configure the routes, amount of police, or their movement speed please go to **UserData \ routes.json**
This mod comes with a utility to help setup patrols. Use F6 to print your coordinates in the console for use in making your own patrols.
